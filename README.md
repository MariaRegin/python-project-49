Each game gives you questions to be answered. If 3 out of 3 questions answered correctly you win. If you make a mistake game terminates and you have to start over. 

You can play following games:    

* Brain-calc
* Brain-even
* Brain-gcd (greatest common divisor)
* Brain-prime
* Brain-progression.

## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install Brain Games.

    	pip install brain-games
